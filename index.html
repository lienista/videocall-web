        description: "What do a towering giraffe and a little farmer have to teach one another? And how will they help each other learn about the joys of sharing? Find out in this tale of farmyard friendship.",
        "1": "There once was a beautiful young girl named Marie, who lived and worked on a busy little fruit farm, deep in the countryside.",
        "2": "Every morning she would wake early, hop aboard her bright red tractor and ride around the farm.",
        "3": "She climbed her trusty old ladder and picked the fruit from the trees to sell at the local market.",
        "4": "But try as she might, Marie could never pick the tastiest, sweetest fruit from the highest branches...",
        "5": "Even from the very top of her ladder, she just couldn’t reach. Yet she still hoped to one day gather that tasty fruit.",
        "6": "Every evening when her work was done, she would sit alone on the warm hillside...",
        "7": "Eating the sweet, fresh fruit while watching the summer sun set peacefully over the meadows.",
        "8": "One day, quite unexpectedly, a lone giraffe came galloping through the farm.",
        "9": "He was by far the tallest animal Marie had ever seen, taller than an acorn tree...and extremely frightened!",
        "10": "“What’s the matter, my mighty friend?” asked Marie.“How can I help?”",
        "11": "The giraffe cried, “I was being chased by hunters, and now I’m lost and alone. I’m so tired and hungry, and I have nowhere to go.”",
        "12": "“That’s so sad,” said Marie. “Why don’t you stay with me? You’ll be safe, and you can eat all the fresh leaves you like.”",
        "13": "“Oh, thank you so much!” exclaimed the giraffe. “That is so kind of you. I promise I’ll be no trouble at all.”","14": "Over time, Marie and the giraffe became the very best of friends.",
        "15": "When she wasn’t working on the farm, they would laugh and play together in the warm summer sunshine.",
        "16": "Every evening they would sit together on the hillside. The giraffe would munch on his leaves, Marie would eat the sweet fruit...",
        "17": "And together they would watch the summer sun set peacefully over the meadows.",
        "18": "One warm, sunny afternoon, the giraffe was taking a walk through the fruit trees...",
        "19": "When he happened upon the barn where the fruit was stored for market.",
        "20": "The giraffe slowly and carefully pushed his long neck through the open window and peered inside.",
        "21": "There he saw barrels, baskets and carts filled to the brim with juicy, ripe fruit.",
        "22": "The giraffe could not resist. The fruit looked so tasty and sweet, and he was bored of eating nothing but leaves all the time.",
        "23": "He squeezed his enormous body inside...",
        "24": "And started eating the sweet fruit. It was delicious!",
        "25": "The hungry giraffe ate and ate, until his belly was fit to burst, and the barrels, baskets and carts were empty.",
        "26": "His face turned a bright shade of green and he began to feel extremely unwell.",
        "27": "Later that afternoon, Marie was enjoying a peaceful stroll through the farm, hoping to find her friend.",
        "28": "Suddenly she heard a pained groaning sound coming from the barn",
        "29": "She burst into the barn to see what had happened...",
        "30": "And was surprised to find the giraffe sitting forlornly among the empty carts, barrels and baskets...surrounded by peels and seeds.",
        "31": "Marie was shocked and saddened to see that her friend had eaten all the fruit, and there was now none left to sell at the market.",
        "32": "“I’m so sorry!” said the giraffe. “I just wanted to taste the fruit...but it was so tasty that I kept eating. Now I feel unwell.”",
        "33": "“Fruit is tasty,” agreed Marie. “And it’s good for you. But eating too much can make anyone feel unwell.”",
        "34": "“But don’t worry, you’ll soon feel better,” she added reassuringly.",
        "35": "“But now I’ve eaten all the fruit, how can you go to market?” asked the giraffe, feeling extremely guilty and rather silly.",
        "36": "“I have an idea!” replied Marie...",
        "37": "“With your long neck, you can easily pick the sweetest, tastiest fruit from the highest branches where no one else can reach.”",
        "38": "“Would you like to help me on the farm?” she asked.",
        "39": "“It would be my pleasure!” replied the giraffe.",
        "40": "So from that day forward, Marie and the giraffe worked happily together on the farm.",
        "41": "They rode around in their bright red tractor, gathering the fruit in the sunshine.",
        "42": "They picked only the sweetest, juiciest, most delicious fruit from the very highest branches, where only the mighty giraffe could reach.",
        "43": "People would travel from miles around to buy the fruit. Everyone agreed it was by far the sweetest and juiciest fruit in all the land.",
        "44": "Every evening after working on the farm, Marie and her friend the giraffe would sit together on the warm hillside...",
        "45": "Eating the sweet, tasty fruit while watching the sun set peacefully over the meadows...",
        "46": "...and the fruit tasted so much sweeter when it was shared."
